# Adaptive_Cruise_Control_System_using_MATLAB
The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) System developed in MATLAB and Simulink utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enable longitudinal speed control for the follower vehicle over a range of speed profiles. The ACC system aims to maintain a safe distance from the leader vehicle while optimizing the gas pedal actuation sequence with less overshoot
